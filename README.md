# SOLID Principles learning

The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.” 

- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

### 1- Single Responsibility
this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.
