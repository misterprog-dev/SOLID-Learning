# SOLID Principles learning

The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.” 

- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

### 1- Single Responsibility
this principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

### 2- Open for Extension, Closed for Modification
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs.

### 3- Liskov Substitution
<u>Principe</u>: if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program
